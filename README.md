# Contentstack SDK implemenation guide: Next with Middleware

This is a bare-bones example to connect Next to Contentstack using the app directory approach.
This example covers the following items:

- SDK initialization
- live preview setup

> This example has Contentstack Live preview set up with a middleware/proxy server in between. This in between server does not use the Contentsteck delivery SDK but uses the API directly. Live preview is set up with SSR mode true. Which means Contentstack adds query parameters to the URL which we grab in the code and give to the delivery API including the live_preview token. Contentstack refreshes the browser on content edit each time.

## How to get started

Before you can run this code, you will need a Contentstack "Stack" to connect to.
Follow the following steps to seed a Stack that this codebase understands.

### Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @contentstack/cli
```

### Log in via the CLI

```bash
csdx auth:login
```

### Get your organization UID

In your Contentstack Organization dashboard find `Org admin` and copy your Organization ID (Example: `blt481c598b0d8352d9`).

### Create a new stack

Make sure to replace `<YOUR_ORG_ID>` with your actual Organization ID and run the below.

```bash
csdx cm:stacks:seed --repo "timbenniks/contentstack-implementation-guides-seed" --org "<YOUR_ORG_ID>" -n "Implementation Guide"
```

### Create a new delivery token.

Go to Settings > Tokens and create a delivery token. Select the `preview` scope and turn on `Create preview token`

### Fill out your .env file.

Now that you have a delivery token, you can fill out the .env file in your codebase.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTSTACK_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTSTACK_DELIVERY_TOKEN=<YOUR_DELIVERY_TOKEN>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTSTACK_PREVIEW_TOKEN=<YOUR_PREVIEW_TOKEN>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<YOUR_REGION>

NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTSTACK_ENVIRONMENT=preview
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTSTACK_PREVIEW=true
```

### Turn on Live Preview

Go to Settings > Live Preview. Click enable and select the `Preview` environment in the drop down. Hit save.

### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run your app

```bash
npm run dev
```

### See your page visually

Go to Entries and select the only entry in the list.
In the sidebar, click on the live preview icon.
Or, click on visual experience in the sidebar
